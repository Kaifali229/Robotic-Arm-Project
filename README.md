Description:
Built a functional robotic arm using Arduino, equipped with servo motors and controlled wirelessly through an Android app developed using MIT App Inventor. The arm demonstrates fundamental concepts of robotic actuation, real-time control, and embedded system communication. The 3D model was designed in Fusion 360 and fabricated with Elegoo Neptune 3 3D printer.
